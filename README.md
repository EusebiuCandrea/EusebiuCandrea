# 👋 Hi, I'm Eusebiu Candrea

🎯 **Senior Android Developer | Mobile Tech Lead | Product-Oriented Engineer**

I'm a passionate Android developer with over 7 years of experience building scalable, modern, and user-focused mobile applications. I combine strong technical skills in native Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM) with product thinking, business insight, and leadership. I have led teams, founded startups, and delivered end-to-end solutions — from concept to launch.

## 🚀 Open Source Projects

Here are some of the libraries I’ve created to help developers build better Android apps:

### 🧩 [ToolTipPopupWordTV](https://github.com/EusebiuCandrea/ToolTipPopupWordTV)
An open source Android library that allows you to show a tooltip-like popup when selecting words in a `TextView`. Fully customizable and easy to integrate.

### 📊 [SimpleAndroidBarChart](https://github.com/EusebiuCandrea/SimpleAndroidBarChart)
A simple, clean bar chart example for Android apps. Designed for extensibility — customize it to match your data visualization needs.
